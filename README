DemoTool Guidance: 

Compiling command in Sparc Machine: 
gcc *.c -o *.out -lpthread -lnsl -lsocket

After call "make", there should be several files: 
test_server
test_client1
test_client2
test_client3

First for testing the server side: 
test_client1:
	There are 5 clients: a~e with listening port number 10000~10004
	They login and request for client list in sequence. After they all login, every client will request the client list for one more time. 

test_client2:
	Still 5 clients same with in test_client1
	a and b login and request for list. c register with a same listening port number as a and d register with a same client name as a. There should be errormessage if the student server works fine. 

test_client3:
	Still 5 clients. 
	a, b and c login and request for list. Then b and c log out, d and e login and request for client list. After that, a request for client list. 

There are sample outputs: test_client1.output test_client2.output and test_client3.output.
